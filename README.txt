N-Queens - java

This program reads from a file to get a size 'n' and creates an nxn chessboard in which each row has a Queen. In chess, Queens can move diagonally and vertically/horizontally. The program rearanges the Queens so that none of them are in conflict with each other no matter where they move.

To excecute, run the 'Board' class in a java editor

A text file specifying board sizes called "nqueens" is already in the folder, but you can either delete it and put in a new one, or just change the values for different sizes of boards.

The program will output the board(s) to a text file as well as display them in the console. It will print the full chessboard with 'q's to indicate the Queens, as well as an array of the Queen's index/position on each row.
